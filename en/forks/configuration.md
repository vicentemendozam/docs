# Configure your fork

## Travis CI

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) is a Continuous Integration service, free for OpenSource projects (like Consul and it's forks). It will help you check on each Pull Request if the test suite is allright.

1. Visit https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci and click the "**Install it for free**" green button at the bottom of the page.

2. Click on the "**Complete order and begin installation**" green button

3. If you are asked to Authorize Travis CI to access your Github account, check the organization or user where you have your consul fork at the bottom and click the "**Authorize travis-ci**" button.

4. Visit [your travis profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile/) and enable Travis for your Consul fork on the repositories list that will appear.

5. Click on the cog button next to your recenlty enabled consul repository to check the builds.

6. Try it out by creating a test Pull Request against your fork (editing a .md file should do the trick)
